# edUi Conference 2017 Presentation

This repo houses the coding examples and demos for my [edUi Conference](http://eduiconf.org) (2017) talk on [progressive web apps](http://eduiconf.org/sessions/progressive-web-apps/), co-presented by [Ashish Pathak](https://github.com/ashishpat).

A summary of the talk can be found below.

### Building Progressive Web Apps

Mobile devices have created a walled garden of mobile apps that have forced teams to maintain multiple projects to build for each device or to rely on wrappers and compilers to get the native experience. If only there was a way to use the power and knowledge of the web to build powerful mobile web applications with device interaction! There is: progressive web apps (PWAs).

With PWAs, developers can take advantage of HTML5 and the new HTML5 JavaScript APIs to put together power mobile web applications that can do everything a native app can do, without using Ionic, Cordova, or some other third-party compiler.

What youâ€™ll learn:

* How a manifest file can prompt users to install an app to their home screen and launch it in standalone mode.

* How a service worker can be used to preload images and assets and prepare the app for offline mode, while offering background sync capabilities.

* How the Fetch API works as an intercept to serve data from a cache or a live API request with ease.

* How to get a mobile web application to serve push notifications to a device just like a native app.

* How to access native hardware from the mobile web, including location, audio, and camera features.
